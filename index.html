		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Virginia Walkup. I am from Rock Hill, SC and have a brother and a sister. We are triplets, all a minute apart. I love animals and being outside. Hiking and playing sports are some of my favorite things to do. I have a dog named Daisy and she is a labradoodle. I go to the University of South Carolina and am a biology major. I love science and am very curious about how things work, I've always been that way. 
		</p>
		<p id="para" class="hidden">A few of my hobbies include reading, cooking, and spending time outside. I love to read classic fiction books. My favorite is the Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Connan Doyle. I also love cooking. I watch a lot of the food network and am always looking out for a new recipe to try. I don't have a sweet tooth so I am more about the savory types of foods. Lastly, spending time outside is something that I have always loved to do. I love walking, running, and playing sports. I used to play lots of soccer but now have moved on to tennis. These things bring me lots of joy in my life.

		<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
		<p>My career plans is to continue studying science. I have not made up my mind about which particular career I want to go into. All I know is that I want to continue learning and gaining experience until I figure out what I want to do. I love healthcare and am looking in that direction. I have shadowed some doctors and nurses, as well as a veterinarian.</p>
		<p>As of right now, I am planning on going to medical school. I have started getting ready for that. However, I am open to learning as much as I can before then. To give myself more time, I am planning on getting my masters degree in Biology. With this, I hope to spend more time in a lab and working and learning with some good people.
